# Auto Bioinformatics Toolbox

The "Auto Bioinformatics Toolbox" streamlines bioinformatic tasks with automation and user-friendly design.

## Features
- **Pairwise Alignment:** Explore functional links between sequences.
- **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA):** Infer homology and evolutionary connections.
- **FASTA to FASTQ Conversion:** Simplify data processing effortlessly.
- **K-mer Counting:** Gain insights into sequence composition.

## Usage
1. **Pairwise Alignment:**
   - Choose BLAST methods for local/global alignment.
   - Input query and database files.

2. **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA):**
   - Select Muscle or Kalign algorithm.
   - Opt for Clustalw, HTML, or MSF formats.

3. **FASTQ to FASTA Conversion:**
   - Input FASTQ file for seamless conversion.

4. **K-mer Counting:**
   - Input FASTA file and define K-mer length.

## Future Enhancements
